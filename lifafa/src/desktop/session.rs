//! Its settings (GNOME's `org.gnome.desktop.interface` and kin), which the
//! locale and GTK know nothing about: the clock format (#173), the
//! monospace font (#181). Read through the settings portal, which works
//! inside the Flatpak sandbox and on the host alike, or — outside the
//! sandbox, when no portal answers — straight from GSettings where the
//! schema is installed. Whether it wants quiet, for a new-mail sound (#292).

//! And its window manager, when the window has to come to the front and
//! `present` is not enough to get it there: see [`present_window`].
